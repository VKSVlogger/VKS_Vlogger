<h1 style='font-size:50px;text-align:center;'>College Day</h1>

<p style='font-size:10px;text-align:center; line-height:20px; margin-bottom:50px;'> When I first came to college, I came without any expectations.<br> Having been through the entire Polytechnic preparation phase, I just wished to escape and be done with the person I had ended up becoming because of it. <br>There are so many things to learn in college. Everybody tells you that, there’s so much to do and so many places to go. But there’s also so much to unlearn. <br>So many things that were made the norm in our households and hometowns had to be forgotten in order to grow up and grow out of the mindsets that had been solidified over the years.</p>
